# Isomonodromic Method

Developed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10638, the isomonodromic method is a novel method for the calculation of the quasinormal modes (QNMs) where using isomonodromic deformation of the Heun and confluent Heun equations, a Riemman-Hilbert map, which relates the accessory parameter and modulus of the equation with two paramaters of the transcendents of Painlevé \tau_{V} and \tau_{III}, is defined. Given that, in https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08790, we applied the method to compute the fundamental quasi-normal modes for scalar, gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations in the asymptotically flat four-dimensional Kerr black hole. Similar analysis for scalar and spinorial perturbation in the Reissner-Nordström black hole was done in https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06929.
