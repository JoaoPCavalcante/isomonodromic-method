# Isomonodromic Method

Developed in [10.1103/PhysRevD.102.105013](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.105013), the isomonodromic method is a novel method for calculating quasinormal modes (QNMs). The goal is to apply the isomonodromic deformation theory to the confluent and doubly confluent Heun equations to write a Riemann-Hilbert map, which relates the accessory parameter and modulus of the equations to two parameters of the transcendents of Painlevé \tau_{V} and \tau_{III}. In [10.1103/PhysRevD.104.084051](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.084051), we applied the method to compute the fundamental quasinormal modes for scalar, gravitational, and electromagnetic perturbations in an asymptotically flat four-dimensional Kerr black hole. A similar analysis of scalar and spinorial perturbations in the Reissner-Nordström black hole was performed in [10.1103/PhysRevD.104.124040](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.124040).
