# isomonodromic-method

This repository brings results for the fundamental quasi-normal modes for scalar, gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations in the Kerr black hole and for scalar and Dirac perturbations in Riessner-Nordström black hole. All results were obtained using the isomonodromic method, developed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10638 and applied in the papers: https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08790 and  https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06929 for Kerr and Riessner-Nordström black hole, respectively.
