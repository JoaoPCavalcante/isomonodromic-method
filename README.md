# Isomonodromic Method

Developed in [10.1103/PhysRevD.102.105013](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.105013), the isomonodromic method is a novel method for the calculation of the quasinormal modes (QNMs). The goal consists in apply the isomonodromic deformation theory to the confluent and doubly-confluent Heun equations in order to write a Riemann-Hilbert map, which relates the accessory parameter and modulus of the equations with two parameters of the transcendents of Painlevé \tau_{V} and \tau_{III}. Given that, in [10.1103/PhysRevD.104.084051](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.084051), we applied the method to compute the fundamental quasinormal modes for scalar, gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations in the asymptotically flat four-dimensional Kerr black hole. Similar analysis for scalar and spinorial perturbations in the Reissner-Nordström black hole was done in [10.1103/PhysRevD.104.124040](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.124040).
